  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>My name is David Barsky. I’m a developer studying computer science at <a href="https://brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a>.</p>

  <p>Previously, I’ve interned at <a href="https://localytics.com">Localytics</a> as an iOS developer, where I started work on a native implementation of the primary dashboard application.</p>

  <p>Before Localytics, I did a bioinformatic study on nuclear protein gene expression at <a href="http://mskcc.org">Sloan Kettering Institute</a>.</p>

  <p>Most of my expertise lies in Swift, Ruby, and recently, Haskell.</p>

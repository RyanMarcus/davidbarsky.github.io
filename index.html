  <h1>I’m David Barsky, a software developer studying computer science at <a href="https://brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a>.</h1>

  <p>I’m too young to have any specialities, but I’ve worked both server (JavaScript, Go) and client-side (iOS). I’m pretty flexible.</p>

  <p>This past summer, I worked for <a href="https://localytics.com">Localytics</a> as an engineering intern, where I developed an iOS port of the web dashboard.</p>

  <p>Before that, I interned at <a href="http://mskcc.org">Sloan Kettering Institute</a>, where I conducted a bioinformatic study on nuclear pore gene expression. I won an award from the Intel Science Talent Search for that, which is pretty neat.</p>

  <p>Feel free to look at my <a href="https://github.com/davidbarsky/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>

<article class="about">
  <p class="primary">My name is David Barsky. I’m a developer studying computer science at <a href="https://brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a>.</p>

  <p>Previously, I’ve interned at <a href="https://localytics.com">Localytics</a> as an iOS developer, where I started work on a native implementation of the dashboard.</p>

  <p>Before Localytics, I did a bioinformatic study on nuclear protein gene expression at <a href="http://mskcc.org">Sloan Kettering Institute</a>.</p>

  <p>I enjoy working with functional programming langauges, so I spend most of my time in Swift and Elixir.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/thramp">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davidbarsky">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/thramp">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-barsky/7b/171/2a3">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
